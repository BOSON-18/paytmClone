//! In the real world, you shouldnâ€™t store `floats` for balances in the database.
//! You usually store an integer which represents the INR value with 
//! decimal places (for eg, if someone has 33.33 rs in their account, 
//! you store 3333 in the database).


//! There is a certain precision that you need to support (which for india is
//! 2/4 decimal places) and this allows you to get rid of precision
//! errors by storing integers in your DB
